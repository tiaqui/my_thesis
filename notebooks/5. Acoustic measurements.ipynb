    "# 5. Acoustic measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final notebook we'll specify some of the **parameters that are widely used in acoustical measurements, more specifically in urban noise measurements, which is the main application of the developed device**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will call some of the functions introduced in the previous notebooks (which are included in `utils.py`) to obtain the different parameters, and **we'll develop new functionality to be able to easily calculate sound pressure levels with the device**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sound pressure level\n",
    "\n",
    "In acoustic measurements the variable that we're interested in is the instantaneous pressure, the dynamic variations in pressure around the atmospheric pressure. This value is **defined as the logarithmic relationship between this instantaneous pressure and the hearing threshold, which is about 20 Î¼P**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ SPL = 10 \\log \\left( \\dfrac{P_{ef}^2}{\\rho_0^2} \\right) \\ [dB_{SPL}] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P_{ef} = \\sqrt{ \\dfrac{1}{T} \\int_{o}^{T} p^2 (t) \\ dt } $$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, $P_{ef}$ represents the RMS value of the instantaneous pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integrating and averaging sound level meters\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the instantaneous SPL will vary at every instant, we normally prefer to obtain a **measurement over a certain time interval, avearing the levels**. This can be obtained by either **exponential or linear averaging of the levels**. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned in the previous notebook the **sound level meters traditionally provided a way to ease the reading of levels by applying an RC integrating low-pass filter to the signal**.  The application of this procedure is known as **exponential averaging** of the sound pressure levels and the type of sound level meters that perform this operation are known as **averaging meters**. The exponential component is introduced to the SPL calculation as seen below.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P_\\tau = \\sqrt{ \\dfrac{1}{\\tau} \\int_{0}^{t} p^2 ( \\theta ) \\ e ^{ - \\dfrac{t-\\theta}{\\tau}  } \\  d\\theta } $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Three time constants are used: Slow ($\\tau$ = 1 s), Fast ($\\tau$ = 125 ms) and Impulse ($\\tau$ = 35 ms)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the thesis we developed an **integrating-averaging meter**, which means that it can also linearly integrate the levels. "
