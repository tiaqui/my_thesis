    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll go through designing and appyling **fractional band-pass filtering** (mainly 1/1 and 1/3 octave filters) to our already processed signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have applied a **frequency weighting filter to the signal** we can obtain a measure of the **global sound pressure level for a certain time interval of interest**. That's nice but, if we want to have **information as to the frequencies in which the measured signal has a high SPL** we need to split this global level in a per-frequency-band indicator.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that, we will **apply band-pass filters to our signal**. The amount of pass-bands filters to apply will be determined by how many different frequency bands we'd like our measurement to be split in. We will explore **1/1 octave and 1/3 octave filters**, increasing three times the level of granularity in the second case.\n",
