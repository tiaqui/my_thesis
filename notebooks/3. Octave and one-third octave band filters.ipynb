    "## 3. Octave and one-third octave band filters\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll go through designing and appyling **fractional band-pass filtering** (mainly 1/1 and 1/3 octave filters) to our already processed signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have applied a **frequency weighting filter to the signal** we can obtain a measure of the **global sound pressure level for a certain time interval of interest**. That's nice but, if we want to have **information as to the frequencies in which the measured signal has a high SPL** we need to split this global level in a per-frequency-band indicator.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that, we will **apply band-pass filters to our signal**. The amount of pass-bands filters to apply will be determined by how many different frequency bands we'd like our measurement to be split in. We will explore **1/1 octave and 1/3 octave filters**, increasing three times the amount of bands for the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Filter specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "The band-pass filters used for acoustical measurements are defined by the **IEC 61260 standard**. In it, the **templates that these filters should follow are specified**. The requirements are given in **two Class based on their performance: Class 1 and Class 2**. Both have the **same design objectives but they different in the acceptance limit**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the filters are defined on a logarithmic scale, **all filters of the same family should have the same response**. So, only one response is specified with the **mid-band frequency normalized to 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the filters, the **exact mid-band frequency** can be determined from the following expression: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f_m = f_rG^{x/b}, \\ \\text{when b is odd} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f_m = f_rG^{(2x+1)/b}, \\ \\text{when b is even} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $ f_r $ is the **reference frequency**, $ G = 10^{0.3} $ is the **octave frequency ratio** (that represents the distance between frequencies that is equal to an octave band), and $ 1/b $ is the **bandwidth designator** (1/1 for octave and 1/3 for third-octave bands, and so on).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll bring over these variables that will allow us to visualize and build our filters."
