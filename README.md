# My engineering thesis

In this repo you'll find some Jupyter notebook examples of different funcionality that was used for my **engineering thesis**: **_"Development of a low-cost urban acoustic monitoring station"_**.

The core code is available in this other repo [RAMON](https://github.com/tiaqui/ramon) (in Spanish), in which you can find functionality for:

* Obtaining input audio in pre-defined cycles of fixed length.
